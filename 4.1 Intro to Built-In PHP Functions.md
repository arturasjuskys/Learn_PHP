# PHP Built-In Functions

## String Functions
We can find PHP built-in functions to accomplish common tasks. Need to reverse a string? There’s a built-in function for that!

The [strrev() function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strrev.php) takes in a string as its argument and returns a string with all of the characters of the original string in reverse order.

Let’s see it in action:
```PHP
echo strrev("Hello, World!"); // Prints: !dlroW ,olleH
```

Remember that we can use the values returned from functions directly (rather than saving them into variables). In the code above, we used echo to print the value returned from invoking the strrev() function with the string "Hello, World!" as its argument.

PHP also comes with built-in functions to change the capitalization of a string. We can use the strtolower() function to transform an argument string into all lowercase letters:
```PHP
echo strtolower("HeLLo"); // Prints: hello
```


Built-in functions often have multiple parameters. The str_repeat() function takes a string as its first argument and a number as its second. It returns a string containing the argument string repeated the argument number of times.
```PHP
echo str_repeat("hi", 10); // Prints: hihihihihihihihihihi 
```

In the above code we used echo to print the value returned from invoking str_repeat() with "hi" and 10 as its arguments—"hihihihihihihihihihi" .

## Working with Substrings
A substring is a portion of a string. For example, "hello" is a substring of the string "Oh hello, how are you?" and "el" is a substring of the string "hello". Manipulating strings is very common in programming, and working with substrings is often necessary.

The substr_count() function returns the number of instances of a substring within a string. It takes two arguments, the string to search through—sometimes called the haystack— and the string to search for—sometimes called the needle.
```PHP
$story = "I was like, \"Dude, like just tell me what you like think because like everyone else is like being totally honest, and like I just want to know what you like think.\" So like I don't know...";
 
echo substr_count($story, "like"); // Prints: 8
```

In the code above, we invoked the substr_count() function, passing in $story as the haystack and "like" as the needle. We used echo to print the returned result—8, which is the number of times the substring "like" appears in the $story string.

## Number Functions
Another common task in programming is working with numbers, so it shouldn’t surprise us that PHP comes with some handy built-in functions for working with numbers.
```PHP
The abs() function returns the absolute value of its number argument:

echo abs(-10.99); // Prints: 10.99
 
echo abs(127); // Prints: 127
```

Another useful function is the round() function which returns the nearest integer to its number argument:
```PHP
echo round(1.2); // Prints: 1
 
echo round(1.5); // Prints: 2
 
echo round(1298736.821763876); // Prints: 1298737
```
