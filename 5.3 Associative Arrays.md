# Learn PHP Arrays

## Associative Arrays
Associative arrays are collections of key=>value pairs. The key in an associative array must be either a string or an integer. The values held can be any type. We use the => operator to associate a key with its value.

We can think of keys as pointing to their values since the key points the computer to the space in memory where the value is stored.
```PHP
$my_array = ["panda" => "very cute", "lizard" => "cute", "cockroach" => "not very cute"];
```

In the code above, we created an associative array using short array syntax. $my_array has three key=>value pairs:
* The key "panda" points to the value "very cute".
* The key "lizard" points to the value "cute".
* The key "cockroach" points to the value "not very cute".

We can also build associative arrays using the PHP array() function.
```PHP
$about_me = array(
    "fullname" => "Aisle Nevertell",
    "social" => 123456789
);
```

In the code above, we created an associative array, $about_me, with two key=>value pairs:
* The key "fullname" points to the value "Aisle Nevertell".
* The key "social" points to the value 123456789.

## Printing Associative Arrays
As with ordered arrays, using echo to print an entire associative array is not very useful:
```PHP
$grades = [
    "Jane" => 98,
    "Lily" => 74,
    "Dan" => 88,
];
 
echo $grades; // Prints: Array
```

We can combine each of the values contained by the array into a single string and use echo to print that:
```PHP
echo implode(", ", $grades); // Prints: 98, 74, 88 
```

A problem with this technique is that it only displays the values. We don’t see the keys in the array or the relationships between the keys and values. To display this information, we can use the built-in print_r() function:
```PHP
print_r($grades);
```

The above code will produce the following output:
```
Array
(
    [Jane] => 98
    [Lily] => 74
    [Dan] => 88
)
```

## Accessing and Adding Elements
We access the value at given key points to using square brackets ([]):
```PHP
$my_array = ["panda"=>"very cute", "lizard"=>"cute", "cockroach"=>"not very cute"];
echo $my_array["panda"]; // Prints: very cute
```

In the code above, we accessed the value "very cute" using its key, "panda".

To add new elements to an associative array, we use the assignment operator (=):
```PHP
$my_array["capybara"] = "cutest";
echo $my_array["capybara"]; // Prints: cutest
```

In the code above, we added a fourth key value pair to the array. We accessed the new value "cutest" using its key "capybara" and printed it using echo.

The computer treats code between the square brackets as an expression, so that code will be evaluated before the array is accessed. This enables us to use variables, functions, and operators within the square brackets:
```PHP
$favorites = ["favorite_food"=>"pizza", "favorite_place"=>"my dreams", "FAVORITE_CASE"=>"CAPS","favorite_person"=>"myself"];
 
echo  $favorites["favorite" . "_" . "food"]; 
// Prints: pizza
 
$key =  "favorite_place";
echo  $favorites[$key];  
// Prints: my dreams
 
echo $favorites[strtoupper("favorite_case")];
// Prints: CAPS
```

## Changing and Removing Elements

The same syntax that adds new array elements can be used to change existing elements:
```PHP
$new_arr = ["first" => "I am first!", "second" => "I am second!"]; 
 
$new_arr["third"] = "I am third!";
 
echo $new_arr["third"]; // Prints: I am third!
 
$new_arr["third"] = "I am the *NEW* third!";
 
echo $new_arr["third"]; // Prints: I am the *NEW* third!
```

In the above code, we use the same syntax to add a key=>value pair ("third" => "I am third!") as we do to assign that key a new value ("third" => "I am the *NEW* third!").

Since PHP will allow us to add a new key=>value pair or change an existing value using exactly the same code, we’ll need to use caution to avoid accidentally overwriting an existing value.

We can remove a key=>value pair entirely using the PHP unset() function. Note: if the key used doesn’t exist in the array, then nothing happens.
```PHP
$nums = ["one" => 1,"two"=> 2];
 
echo implode(", ", $nums); // Prints: 1, 2
 
unset($nums["one"]);
 
echo implode(", ", $nums); // Prints: 2
```

In the code above, we created an associative array with two key => value pairs. We then removed the pair "one" => 1 using the unset() function. 

## Joining Arrays

PHP also lets us combine arrays. The union (+) operator takes two array operands and returns a new array with any unique keys from the second array appended to the first array.
```PHP
$my_array = ["panda" => "very cute", "lizard" => "cute", "cockroach" => "not very cute"];
$more_rankings = ["capybara" => "cutest", "lizard" => "not cute", "dog" => "max cuteness"];
$animal_rankings = $my_array + $more_rankings;
```

The $animal_rankings we created above will have each of the key=>value pairs from $my_array. In addition, it will contain the key=>value pairs from $more_rankings: "capybara"=>"cutest" and "dog"=>"max cuteness". However, since "lizard" is not a unique key, $animal_rankings\["lizard"] will retain the value of $my_array\["lizard"] (which is "cute").

The union operator can be a little tricky… consider the following union:
```PHP
$number_array = [8, 3, 7];
 
$string_array = ["first element", "second element", "third element"];
 
$union_array = $number_array + $string_array;
```

What values does $union_array hold? It has the elements 8, 3, and 7. Since the two arrays being joined have identical keys (0, 1, and 2), no values from the second array, $string_array, are included in $union_array. 

## Assign by Value or by Reference

There are two ways to assign one variable to another:
* By value—this creates two variables which hold copies of the same value but remain independent entities.
* By reference—this creates two variable names (aliases) which point to the same space in memory. They cannot be modified separately!

This remains true when dealing with array variables:
```PHP
$favorites = ["food"=>"pizza", "person"=>"myself", "dog"=>"Tadpole"];
$copy = $favorites;
$alias =& $favorites;
$favorites["food"] = "NEW!";
 
echo $favorites["food"]; // Prints: NEW!
echo $copy["food"]; // Prints: pizza
echo $alias["food"]; // Prints: NEW!
```

When passing arrays into functions, both built-in functions and those we write ourselves, we’ll want to be conscious of whether the arrays are being passed by value or by reference.
```PHP
function changeColor ($arr) 
{
  $arr["color"] = "red";    
}
$object = ["shape"=>"square", "size"=>"small", "color"=>"green"];
changeColor ($object);
echo $object["color"]; // Prints: green
```

Our function above doesn’t accept its array argument by reference. Therefore, $arr is merely assigned a copy of the argument’s value. This copy array is changed when the function is invoked, but that doesn’t affect the orginal argument array ($object). To do that, we’d need to pass it by reference:
```PHP
function reallyChangeColor (&$arr) 
{
  $arr["color"] = "red";    
}
$object = ["shape"=>"square", "size"=>"small", "color"=>"green"];
reallyChangeColor ($object);
echo $object["color"]; // Prints: red
```

## Review

You learned so much in this lesson! Let’s review:
* Associative arrays are data structures in which string or integer keys are associated with values.
* We use the => operator to associate a key with its value. $my_array = ["panda"=>"very cute"]
* To print an array’s keys and their values, we can use the print_r() function.
* We access the value associated with a given key by using square brackets ([ ]). For example: $my_array["panda"] will return "very cute".
* We can assign values to keys using this same indexing syntax and the assignment operator (=): $my_array["dog"] = "good cuteness";
* This same syntax can be used to change existing elements. $my_array["dog"] = "max cuteness";
* We can remove a key=>value pair entirely using the PHP unset() function.
* Keys can be integers. In fact, ordered arrays are just arrays in which integer keys have been assigned to the values automatically.
* In PHP, associative arrays and ordered arrays are different uses of the same data type.
* The union (+) operator takes two array operands and returns a new array with any unique keys from the second array appended to the first array.
* When writing function with array parameters, we can pass the array by value or by reference depending on our intent.
