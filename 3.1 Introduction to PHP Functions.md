# Introduction to Functions in PHP

## Defining Functions
Let’s get right to it and create our first function:
```PHP
function greetLearner($param = "default param")
{
  echo "Hello, Learner!\n";
  echo "I hope you're enjoying PHP!\n";
  echo "Love, Codecademy";

  return $param;
}

greetLearner($param);
```

## Pass By Reference
We can invoke functions with variables or with values directly. When we invoke a function with a variable as its argument, it’s as if we’re assigning the value held by that variable to the function’s parameter. We assign a copy of the value held by the argument variable. The variable argument and the parameter are distinct entities; changes made inside the function to the parameter will not affect the variable that was passed in:
```PHP
function addX ($param)
{
  $param = $param . "X";
  echo $param;
};
$word = "Hello";
addX($word); // Prints: HelloX
echo $word; // Prints: Hello
```

Let’s walk through the code above:
* We defined a function addX() which reassigns $param to its previous value appended with "X".
* We defined the variable $word and assigned it the value "Hello".
* We invoked addX() with $word as its argument.
* During the function invocation, $param was reassigned and the function printed "HelloX".
* When we printed $word after the function was invoked, it remained its original value: "Hello".

If we do want to make permanent changes to a variable within a function, we can prepend the parameter name with the reference sign (&). In this way, we assign the parameter to be an alias for the argument variable. Both will refer to the same spot in memory, and changes to the parameter within the function will permanently affect the argument variable.
```PHP
function addXPermanently (&$param)
{
  $param = $param . "X";
  echo $param;
};
$word = "Hello";
addXPermanently($word); // Prints: HelloX
echo $word; // Prints: HelloX
```

In the addXPermanently() function we made $param a reference to the argument. When we invoked the function with $word the changes made to $param permanently affected the $word variable. Let’s practice!

## Variable Scope
Passing arguments into a function and returning values is a clear way to define the interface between the function and the rest of the code. This is the preferred method of exchanging information within a program since it is straightforward to see the data a function depends on from the function parameter list.

Consider the following function. It returns a number of days left of feed depending on the number of chickens and the rate at which they consume it.
```PHP
function calculateDaysLeft($feed_quantity, $number, $rate)
{
  $result = $feed_quantity / ($number * $rate);
  return $result;
}
echo calculateDaysLeft(300, 2, 30);
```

You can immediately see that this function depends on three pieces of information to provide an answer:
* $feed_quantity
* $number
* $rate

We also echo what is returned by the function, instead of a variable from inside the function. If we attempted to:
```PHP
echo $result;
```

outside of the function, it would throw an error (Undefined variable). This is due to variable scope. Each function has its own local scope. This means that any variables defined within the function’s code block can only be accessed within the code block itself.

However, if many functions depend on the same piece of information, it can be beneficial to have a variable that can be accessed anywhere without being passed in. To do this, we have to use the global keyword to tell PHP to look in the global scope for the variable, instead of the local scope of the function.
```PHP
$feed_quantity = 300;
function calculateDaysLeft($number, $rate)
{
  global $feed_quantity;
  $result = $feed_quantity / ($number * $rate);
  return $result;
}
echo calculateDaysLeft(2, 120);
```

When using this pattern, it becomes slightly more difficult to determine what information this function depends on. Make sure to consider this trade-off when implementing your own functions.

Note that the global keyword is not used when invoking functions. Once a function has been defined, it can be used within the same code block or even within other function code blocks. This code will print “This works!” to the console.
```PHP
function first()
{
  echo "This works!\n";
}
function second()
{
  first();
}
second();
```

## Review
Great job! Let’s review what we covered in this lesson:
* We can package a set of instructions within a named function to reuse whenever we’d like.
* When we invoke a function, the computer will execute the function body, specified by the code block following the parameters list.
* Functions can return a value by using the return keyword otherwise they return NULL which means no value.
* We can store the return value of a function in a variable or use it any other way we’d use a value.
* We can define functions with parameters which are variables we can refer to throughout our function’s body.
* When invoking functions, the values that we give them are called arguments.
* Functions can have multiple parameters.
* The order in which the arguments are passed in decides which parameters they correspond to.
* You can make an argument optional by providing its corresponding parameter with a default value.
* If you prepend a parameter with the reference sign (&) that argument will be passed by reference.
* Variables within functions have local scope and can not be accessed from outside the function.
* Use the global keyword to use variables from the global scope within a function.
