# HTML Form Handling in PHP

## Request Superglobals

Since PHP was built with web development as a primary use case, it has functionality to ease processing of HTML requests. When the front end client makes a request to a backend PHP server, several superglobals related to the request are available to the PHP script. Superglobals are automatic global variables which are available in all scopes throughout a script.

The list of superglobals in PHP includes the following:
* $GLOBALS
* $_SERVER
* $_GET
* $_POST
* $_FILES
* $_COOKIE
* $_SESSION
* $_REQUEST
* $_ENV

For this lesson, we are focusing on three of these:
* $_GET - this contains an associative array of variables passed to the current script using query parameters in the URL
* $_POST - this contains an associative array of variables passed to the current script using a form submitted using the “POST” method
* $_REQUEST - this contains the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE

## GET Form Handling

In HTML, setting a form’s method attribute to "get" specifies that you would like the form to be submitted using the GET method. When using this method, the form entries are passed as parameters in a URL query string.

For example, this is a request to www.codecademy.com with the URL parameters first (set to the value "ellen") and last (set to the value "richards"):
```
www.codecademy.com/?first=ellen&last=richards
```

The parameter names (first and last) come from the name attribute of each form input.

For example, the following form could be used to collect an individual’s name using the GET method:
```HTML
<form method="get">
First name: <input type="text" name="first">
<br>
Last name: <input type="text" name="last">
<br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit Name">
</form>
```

When the form is submitted, the form data is available in the $_GET superglobal array. (The data is also accessible using $_REQUEST if you do not care about which method was used by the client.)

In our example, if a user typed “ellen” into the first input and “richards” into the last input, then print_r($_GET) would look like this:
```PHP
Array ( [first] => ellen [last] => richards )
```

## Using the "action" Attribute

Until now, we’ve been handling the response to the form submission on the same page as the form itself. Often times there is no need to present a user with the same form over and over again. It might make sense to move them to a new page or thank them for their submission.

This is where the action form attribute comes into play. Since we have not specified an action yet, HTML defaults to submitting the form data back to the same script that defined the form.

If you would like to have the user navigate to a new URL and handle the form input there, you can specify the URL in the form’s action attribute. Since the action attribute specifies a relative URL, you can also enter the name of a PHP file in the same directory as the current one.

For example, given this directory:
```
index.php
receive_form.php
```

To handle a form using receive_form.php from index.php, you would use the following:
```PHP
<form method="get" action="receive_form.php">
```

This works for both GET and POST methods.
