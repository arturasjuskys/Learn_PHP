# Conditionals and Logic in PHP

## The Xor Operator

The logical operator xor stands for exclusive or. It takes two different boolean values or expressions as its operands and returns a single boolean value. Unlike regular or which evaluates to TRUE if either its left operand or its right operand evaluate to TRUE, xor evaluates to TRUE only if either its left operand or its right operand evaluate to TRUE, but not both.
```PHP
TRUE xor TRUE;   // Evaluates to: FALSE
 
FALSE xor TRUE;  // Evaluates to: TRUE
 
TRUE xor FALSE;  // Evaluates to: TRUE
 
FALSE xor FALSE; // Evaluates to: FALSE
```

We can use xor to answer either/or questions: Did you wear either glasses or contacts today?
* If neither, the answer is “No”—I didn’t wear glasses nor did I wear contacts. My vision is impaired.
* If I wore both, the answer is “No”—I didn’t wear either glasses or contacts. My vision is impaired.
* If I wore contacts, the answer is “Yes”—I wore contacts, so my vision was corrected.
* If I wore glasses, the answer is “Yes”—I wore glasses, so my vision was corrected. .

Let’s code up this example:
```PHP
$is_wearing_glasses = TRUE;
$is_wearing_contacts = TRUE;
 
if ($is_wearing_glasses xor $is_wearing_contacts){
    echo "Your vision is corrected!";
} else {
    echo "Your vision is impaired.";
}
```

## Alternate Syntax
An alternate syntax for logical || operator is the or operator, and an alternate syntax for logical && operator is the and operator. These operators have the advantage of making our code more human readable.
```PHP
// The or Operator:
TRUE or TRUE;   // Evaluates to: TRUE
FALSE or TRUE;  // Evaluates to: TRUE
TRUE or FALSE;  // Evaluates to: TRUE
FALSE or FALSE; // Evaluates to: FALSE
 
// The and Operator:
TRUE and TRUE;   // Evaluates to: TRUE
FALSE and TRUE;  // Evaluates to: FALSE
TRUE and FALSE;  // Evaluates to: FALSE
FALSE and FALSE; // Evaluates to: FALSE
```
The computer treats these operators slightly differently from the symbol operators due to operator precedence. The or and and logical operators have a lower precedence than || and &&.
```PHP
TRUE || TRUE && FALSE // Evaluates to: TRUE
TRUE || TRUE and FALSE // Evaluates to: FALSE
```
As we mentioned before, we can avoid operator precedence confusion by using parentheses for force the evaluation we want:
```PHP
(TRUE || TRUE) && FALSE // Evaluates to: FALSE
TRUE || (TRUE and FALSE) // Evaluates to: TRUE
```
Going forward you can use whichever logical operators you prefer, but let’s get some practice with and and or.

## Multi-File Programs: include

Separation of concerns is the programming design principle of organizing code into distinct sections each handling a specific task. It enables us to quickly navigate our code and know where to look if something isn’t working. We’ve seen how functions can allow us to practice separation of concerns—by packaging certain routines in functions, we’re able to write cleaner code. But when programs start to get very long, functions aren’t always enough.

Another way to improve our code and separate concerns is with modularity, separating a program into distinct, manageable chunks where each provides a piece of the overall functionality. Instead of having an entire program located in a single file, code is organized into separate files. Each file is then included in our main program with the keyword include. An include statement will bring the code from a file into the current file and also run the code. It’s as if all the code from that file was written right there. We provide the path to the file to be included as a string.

For example, let’s say we had three files one.php, two.php, and index.php, and we want to include the code from files one.php and two.php inside index.php:
```PHP
// one.php
echo "How are";
```
```PHP
// two.php
echo " you?";
```
```PHP
// index.php
echo "Hello! ";
include "one.php";
include "two.php";
// Prints: Hello! How are you?
```
When we run index.php Hello! How are you? is printed to the terminal.

This example is a little silly because we’re barely including any code in the separate files. Let’s get some practice including more significant chunks of code into our main program!

## Review

Great job! You’ve learned the tools needed to craft programs with powerful decision making capabilities. Let’s review what we covered:
* By nesting conditionals within one another, we can create branching decisions.
* The logical operator || takes two different boolean values or expressions as its operands and returns a single boolean value. It returns TRUE if either its left operand or its right operand evaluate to TRUE.
* The logical && operator returns TRUE only if both of its operands evaluate to TRUE. It returns FALSE if either or both of its operands evaluate to FALSE.
* The logical not operator (!) takes only a right operand. It reverses the boolean value of its operand.
* The logical exclusive or operator (xor) returns TRUE only if either its left operand or its right operand evaluate to TRUE, but not both or neither.
* PHP includes alternate syntax for the || and && operators: we can use or in place of ||, and we can use and in place of &&. These operators work much the same way but have different operator precedence.
* We can include code from one file inside another with include which allows us to write mode modular programs.
