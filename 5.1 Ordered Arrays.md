# Learn PHP Arrays

## Creating Arrays with array()
PHP arrays can also store elements of multiple data types:
```PHP
$mixed_array = array(1, "chicken", 78.2, "bubbles are crazy!");
```

## Creating Arrays with Short Syntax
In addition to using array(), we can also create an array by wrapping comma-separated elements in square brackets ([ ]). This feature is sometimes referred to as short array syntax, and more closely resembles what you might see in other programming languages.
```PHP
$number_array = [0, 1, 2];
$long_array = [
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5,
  6
];
```

## Printing Arrays
Since arrays are a more complicated data type than strings or integers, printing them is slightly more challenging. Using echo won’t have the desired result:
```PHP
$number_array = [0, 1, 2];
echo $number_array; // Prints: Array
```

When we tried to use echo to print $number_array, it printed the word “Array” rather than the contents of the array. To print the contents of the array, we can use PHP built-in functions. The built-in print_r() function outputs arrays in a human readable format:
```PHP
print_r($number_array);
```

This will output the array in the following format:
```
Array
(
    [0] => 0
    [1] => 1
    [2] => 2
)
```

If we merely want to print the elements in the array listed, we can convert the array into a string using the built-in implode() function. The implode() function takes two arguments: a string to use between each element (the $glue), and the array to be joined together (the $pieces):
```PHP
echo implode(", ", $number_array);
```

This will output in the following format:
```
0, 1, 2
```

## Adding and Changing Elements
We can make adjustments to existing arrays—we don’t have to create a new array when we want our array to change.

We add elements to the end of an array by taking the variable name and appending square brackets ([]), the assignment operator (=), and the element we want to add:
```PHP
$string_array = ["first element", "second element"];
 
$string_array[] = "third element";
 
echo implode(", ", $string_array); 
// Prints: first element, second element, third element 
```

We can also reassign the individual elements in an array:
```PHP
$string_array = ["first element", "second element", "third element"];
 
$string_array[0] = "NEW! different first element";
 
echo $string_array[0]; // Prints: NEW! different first element"
```

In the code above, we replaced the original string held in the array ("first element") with a new string value: "NEW! different first element".

## More Array Methods: Pushing and Popping
In the previous exercise, we learned how to add single array elements and to change array elements at a given index. PHP also provides us with built-in methods for removing array elements, and for adding many elements at once.

The array_pop() function takes an array as its argument. It removes the last element of an array and returns the removed element.
```PHP
$my_array = ["tic", "tac", "toe"];
array_pop($my_array); 
// $my_array is now ["tic", "tac"]
$popped = array_pop($my_array); 
// $popped is "tac"
// $my_array is now ["tic"]
```

Note that array_pop() doesn’t just set the last element to NULL. It actually removes it from the array, meaning that array’s length will decrease by one (which we can verify using count()).

The array_push() function takes an array as its first argument. The arguments that follow are elements to be added to the end of the array. array_push() adds each of the elements to the array and returns the new number of elements in the array.
```PHP
$new_array = ["eeny"];
$num_added = array_push($new_array, "meeny", "miny", "moe"); 
echo $num_added; // Prints: 4
echo implode(", ", $new_array); // Prints: eeny, meeny, miny, moe 
```

## Shifting and Unshifting
We saw that array_pop() and array_push() deal exclusively with the end of the array (the index at the length of the array minus 1). PHP also provides functions for adding and removing elements from the beginning of an array (index 0).

The array_shift() function removes the first element of an array and returns that value. Each of the elements in the array will be shifted down an index. For example, the element that was previously at the 3rd index will now be located at the 2nd.
```PHP
$adjectives = ["bad", "good", "great", "fantastic"];
$removed = array_shift($adjectives); 
echo $removed; //Prints: bad
echo implode(", ", $adjectives); // Prints: good, great, fantastic 
```

Just like array_pop(), array_shift() reduces the length of the array, and the deleted element is gone for good.

The array_unshift() function takes an array as its first argument. The arguments that follow are elements to be added to the beginning of the array. It returns the new number of elements in the array.
```PHP
$foods = ["pizza", "crackers", "apples", "carrots"];
$arr_len = array_unshift($foods, "pasta", "meatballs", "lettuce"); 
echo $arr_len; //Prints: 7
echo implode(", ", $foods); 
// Prints: pasta, meatballs, lettuce, pizza, crackers, apples, carrots
```

## Review
We covered a lot in this lesson! Great job. Take a second to review everything you learned:
* Arrays are ordered collections of data that are a type of data structure fundamental to computer science.
* In PHP, we refer to this data structure as ordered arrays.
* The location of an element in an array is known as its index.
* The elements in an ordered array are arranged in ascending numerical order starting with index zero.
* We can construct ordered arrays with a built-in PHP function: array().
* We can construct ordered arrays with short array syntax, e.g. [1,2,3].
* We can print arrays using the built-in print_r() function or by converting them into strings using the implode() function.
* We use square brackets ([]) to access elements in an array by their index.
* We can add elements to the end of an array by appending square brackets ([]) to an array variable name and assigning the value with the assignment operator (=).
* We can change elements in an array using array indexing and the assignment operator.
* The array_pop() function removes the last element of an array.
* The array_push() function adds elements to the end of an array.
* The array_shift() function removes the first element of an array.
* The array_unshift() function adds elements to the beginning of the array.
* We can use chained square brackets ([]) to access and change elements within a nested array.
