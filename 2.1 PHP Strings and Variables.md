# Learn PHP Variables

## String Concatenation
It can be useful to combine two strings together. This process is called string concatenation, and we can use the concatenation operator (.) to do this.

An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. The computer will take the string to the left of the concatenation operator, combine it with the string to the right, and return the resulting single string. Let’s see an example of string concatenation:
```PHP
echo "one" . "two"; // Prints: onetwo
```

Notice how the string “onetwo” was printed. The computer won’t make any assumptions for us—it will combine the strings exactly as they are without adding any spaces or line-breaks. If we want spaces, we’ll have to add any spaces we want ourselves. Here we added a space to the string "one ":
```PHP
echo "one " . "two"; // Prints: one two
```

We can also combine, or chain, our operations to get a final result:
```PHP
echo "one" . " " . "two" . " " . "three"; // Prints: one two three
```

The concatenation operator takes two strings (the operands) and produces a string as a result (the return value). As we delve deeper into PHP, we’ll learn about other kinds of operators. Most will take one or two operands, but there’s even one that takes three.

## Creating Variables
Let’s look at an example of creating a variable:
```PHP
$my_name = "Aisle Nevertell";
```

## Variable Parsing
In the last exercise, we saw how concatenating a number of strings and string variables got annoying. There’s an easier way!

PHP strings allow us to place variables directly into double quoted strings. These variables will be parsed which means the computer will read the variables as the value they hold rather than see them as just a sequence of characters.
```PHP
$dog_name = "Tadpole";
$favorite_food = "salmon";
$color = "brown";
 
echo "I have a $color dog named $dog_name and her favorite food is $favorite_food.";
// Prints: I have a brown dog named Tadpole and her favorite food is salmon.
```

## Concatenating Assignment Operator
```PHP
$full_name = "Aisle";
$full_name = $full_name . " Nevertell";
echo $full_name; // Prints: Aisle Nevertell
```

In the code above, we have the variable $full_name assigned the value "Aisle". We want to reassign $full_name to its current value appended with the string " Nevertell".

Believe it or not, this is such a common task that PHP offers a shorthand notation, the concatenating assignment operator (.=). Let’s compare the same action but using this alternate operator:
```PHP
$full_name = "Aisle";
$full_name .= " Nevertell";
echo $full_name; // Prints: Aisle Nevertell
```

It may seem funny to provide a shortcut to save just a few characters of typing, but when operations are performed often enough, those keystrokes can really add up. This syntax is also faster and easier to read which makes code easier to maintain.

One important thing to note is that even though PHP is often flexible about whitespace, it is inflexible with the concatenating assignment operator—the . and = characters must not have any spaces or other whitespace characters between them.

## Assign by Reference
When we create a variable assigned to another variable, the computer finds a new space in memory which it associates with the left operand, and it stores a copy of the right operand’s value there.

This new variable holds a copy of the value held by the original variable, but it’s an independent entity; changes made to either variable won’t affect the other:
```PHP
$first_player_rank = "Beginner"; 
$second_player_rank = $first_player_rank; 
echo $second_player_rank; // Prints: Beginner
 
$first_player_rank = "Intermediate"; // Reassign the value of $first_player_rank
echo $second_player_rank; // Still Prints: Beginner
```

We can also create an alias, or nickname, for a variable. Instead of a copy of the original variable’s value, we create a new name which points to the same spot in memory.

We use a different operator for this—the reference assignment operator (=&).

When we assign by reference we’re saying that the variable on the left of the operator should point, or refer, to the exact same data as the variable on the right. With assignment by reference, changes made to one variable will affect the other:
```PHP
$first_player_rank = "Beginner";
$second_player_rank =& $first_player_rank; 
echo $second_player_rank; // Prints: Beginner
 
$first_player_rank = "Intermediate"; // Reassign the value of $first_player_rank
echo $second_player_rank; // Prints: Intermediate
```

## Review
Awesome work! We’ve covered a lot of material in this lesson, so let’s review:
* Strings are collections of text that the computer treats as a single piece of data.
* A string can be any length and contain any letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces surrounded by quotation marks.
* In order to include certain characters inside strings we have to use escape sequences.
* An operator is a character that performs a task in our code.
* We can use the concatenation operator (.) to combine two strings into one.
* Variables are a fundamental programming concept which allow us to easily reuse data in our code.
* We declare a variable using the dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name and then use the assignment operator (=) to give it a value.
* PHP has variable parsing which allows us to include variables directly in our strings.
* Once a variable has been assigned, we can change its value. This is called reassignment.
* We can create an alias for a variable, instead of just a copy, using the reference assignment operator (=&).
* Operations to the right of the assignment operator will be evaluated before assignment takes place.
* The concatenating assignment operator (.=) is a shorthand notation for reassigning a string variable to its current value appended with another string value.
