# Conditionals and Logic in PHP

## Elseif Statements

So far, we’ve been writing conditionals that can only handle one condition. If that condition is met, we do one thing, otherwise we do something else. This only allows us one or two courses of action. But programs can be far more complex.

Consider letter grades on a school assignment:
* If the grade is less than 60, it’s an F
* Or else, if the grade is less than 70, it’s a D.
* Or else, if the grade is less than 80, it’s a C.
* Or else, if the grade is less than 90, it’s a B.
* Or else, it’s an A.

We can write conditionals with multiple if statements using the elseif construction. The computer will continue through each condition until it finds a condition which is met or gets to the end—whichever comes first.

Let’s implement our letter grades example in code:
```PHP
$grade = 88;
if ($grade < 60) {
  echo "You got an F";
} elseif ($grade < 70) {
  echo "You got a D";
} elseif ($grade < 80) {
  echo "You got a C";
} elseif ($grade < 90) {
  echo "You got a B";
} else {
  echo "You got an A";
}
```

In the code above, $grade has a value of 88. The computer will check each condition until one is met and run that block of code. When it gets to the condition $grade < 90, it evaluates to TRUE. That code block executes, and You got a B is logged to the terminal.

Notice that the order of our conditionals is important. The grade 55 would satisfy the condition $grade < 90, but it meets the condition intended for it, $grade < 60 first. What if the elseif statements were in a different order?
```PHP
$grade = 55;
if ($grade < 90) {
  echo "You got a B";
} elseif ($grade < 80) {
  echo "You got a C";
} elseif ($grade < 70) {
  echo "You got a D";
} elseif ($grade < 60) {
  echo "You got an F";
} else {
  echo "You got an A";
}
```

The code above will output You got a B to the terminal since the computer will run the first TRUE condition. We need to take care when constructing our conditionals that they have the outcome we want.

Note: you may encounter the keywords else if with a space separating the two words. In many situations, else if will work the same way as elseif. Since elseif works more universally, that’s what we choose to use. 

## Switch Statement

We often want to compare a value, expression, or variable against many different possible values and run different code depending on which it matches. We can use a series of if/elseif statements which use the identical operator (===) or we can use a switch statement—an alternate syntax.

We wrote some code with if/elseif statements to print a string based on a student’s letter grade:
```PHP
if ($letter_grade === "A"){
  echo "Terrific";
} elseif ($letter_grade === "B") {
  echo "Good";
} elseif ($letter_grade === "C") {
  echo "Fair";
} elseif ($letter_grade === "D") {
  echo "Needs Improvement";
} elseif ($letter_grade === "F") {
  echo "See me!";
} else {
  echo "Invalid grade"; 
}
```

Since this code involves a series of comparisons, it’s ripe for a switch statement! Let’s see it refactored with switch:
```PHP
switch ($letter_grade){
  case "A":
    echo "Terrific";
    break;
  case "B":
    echo "Good";
    break;
  case "C":
    echo "Fair";
    break;
  case "D":
    echo "Needs Improvement";
    break;
  case "F":
    echo "See me!";
    break;
  default:
    echo "Invalid grade"; 
}
```
We begin the keyword switch followed by the value (or expression) we’ll be comparing—in this case, $letter_grade. We provide possible matches for the expression with the keyword case, the potential matching value, and the colon. For each case, we provide code that should run if that case matches. After each case, we include the keyword break to break out of the switch statement. We can provide a default that should run if none of the provided cases match.

A switch statement is a good example of code that might be preferable not because it’s shorter, but rather because it clearly indicates the purpose of the code; when looking at a switch statement we can quickly identify the important aspects of the code; this makes it easier to understand, extend, and debug.

## Switch Statements: Fall through

In the previous exercise, we taught you to use the keyword break after the block for each case. Without the keyword break, not only will the first matching case’s block run, but so will all the code in the subsequent cases! This is known as fall through. The keyword break tells the computer to break out of the switch statement, without it, it will fall through the rest of the switch executing all the code until it reaches a break, a return, or the end of the statement:
```PHP
$letter = "a";
switch ($letter) {
  case "a":
    echo "a";
  case "b":
    echo "b";
  case "c":
    echo "c";
  case "d":
    echo "d";
}
```
The code above will output abcd. Only the first case (case "a") actually matches the value of $letter, but since the above code doesn’t have any breaks all of the code in the switch will execute. Fall through may seem like a drag, but it can be useful when we want multiple cases to execute the same code:
```PHP
switch ($day_of_week) {
  case "Monday":
  case "Tuesday":
    echo "Just getting started!";
    break;
  case "Wednesday":
    echo "Humpday!";
    break;
  case "Thursday":
  case "Friday":
    echo "Almost the weekend!";
    break;
  case "Saturday":
  case "Sunday":
    echo "Enjoy!";
    break;
}
```
In the code above, we use fall through to our advantage by placing cases that should execute the same code next to each other and having them share a code block. So, for example, if $day_of_week has the value "Monday" or "Tuesday", the string "Just getting started!" will be printed.

It’s ok if you don’t find fall through useful in your own code. But knowing how to use it should remind you that it exists and that you need those breaks!

## Ternary Operator

PHP offers a short-hand syntax to conditionally return a value. Before learning it, let’s consider some example code:
```PHP
$isClicked = FALSE;
if ( $isClicked ) {
  $link_color = "purple";
} else {
  $link_color = "blue";
}
```
In the code above, our condition checks the value of the $isClicked variable. If it’s TRUE we assign $link_color to "purple", otherwise we assign it the value "blue". Our code is somewhat repetitive—the code in each code block is only slightly different.

A ternary operator (?:) is another conditional operator. It takes three operands and returns a value:
* The first operand is a condition to check. This is followed by a question mark ?.
* The second operand is an expression to return if the condition is TRUE. This is followed by a colon (:).
* The third operand is an expression to return if the condition is FALSE.

Let’s see our previous example refactored with the ternary operator:
```PHP
$isClicked = FALSE;
$link_color = $isClicked ? "purple" : "blue";
```
The ternary operator allows us to write fewer lines of code while maintaining readability.

Note that code in the expression will be executed, but the intended use of the ternary is to conditionally return a value not to execute code.

## User Input: readline()

The outcomes of programs we’ve been writing so far have been predetermined. Unless we manually change our code, it will produce the same results each time it’s run. But this isn’t very realistic. Programs often receive unexpected inputs or results which is why we need conditionals. Conditionals allow us to write flexible programs that handle this variability.

One common reason our programs need to be flexible is when they have user interaction. When we create a website, we don’t know exactly when a user will press a button or exactly what text they’ll input in a form. Writing programs that can handle unique user interaction is a big part of software development.

User interaction isn’t restricted to web development. We can enable user interaction in our terminal-based programs as well.

The built-in readline() function takes a string with which to prompt the user. It waits for the user to enter text into the terminal and returns that value as a string.
```PHP
echo "Hi, I'm Aisle Nevertell. What's your name?\n";
$name = readline(">> ");
echo "\nNice to meet you, $name";
```
The code above prints, Hi, I'm Aisle Nevertell. What's your name?. Then, it prints >> to the terminal to prompt the user to type and awaits their input which it will save in the $name variable. If the user entered Alex, for example, the program would next print Nice to meet you, Alex to the terminal.

By incorporating in conditionals, we can take different actions depending on the user input:
```PHP
echo "\nWhat's your favorite color?\n";
$color = readline(">> ");
if ($color === "green"){
  echo "\nCool, that's my favorite too!";
} else {
  echo "\nOh, $color is nice, I guess…";
}
```

In the code above, we prompt the user to enter their favorite color. If they say our favorite color (green), we give one response, otherwise we give a different response. 

## Review

Woah! We covered a lot in this lesson. Good work. Let’s review what we learned:
* Conditionals make it possible for programs to decide how to react to a wide variety of situations.
* if statements allow us to run a block of code if a condition is met.
* The boolean data type is either the value TRUE or FALSE and is the foundation of programmatic decision making.
* We use else to include a block of code to run when the condition is not met.
* Comparison operators evaluate a relationship between two operands and return a boolean value.
  * The less than operator (<)
  * The less than or equal to operator (<=)
  * The greater than operator (>)
  * The greater than or equal to operator (>=)
  * The Identical operator (===)
  * The not identical operator (!==)
* We can write conditionals with multiple if statements using the elseif construction.
* Instead of using a series of if statements when we want to compare a value, expression, or variable against many different possible values and run different code depending on which it matches, we can use a switch statement.
* The keyword break tells the computer to break out of the switch statement, without it, it will fall through the rest of the switch executing all the code until it reaches a break or the end of the statement.
* A ternary operator (?:) is shorthand conditional operator. It takes three operands (a condition to check, an expression to return if the condition is TRUE, and an expression to return if the condition is FALSE).
* Any value or expression inside a condition will be converted to TRUE or FALSE. We consider values that will convert to TRUE to be truthy and values that will convert to FALSE to be falsy.
* We can get user input from the terminal with the readline() function.
